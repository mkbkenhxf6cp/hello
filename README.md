Awesome Material Components is a collection of resources related to official Google's Material Components (as opposed to a broad topic of community-based implementations of Material Design in the existing list).

The goal of this list is to increase user adoption of Material Components by sharing
the knowledge about its community. So, if you have an interesting MDC-based project or tutorial,
feel free to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please don't forget to star this repo and [share it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20Awesome%20Material%20Components%20-%20curated%20list%20of%20projects%20based%20on%20Google%27s%20Material%20Components%20%E2%86%92&url=https://github.com/webdenim/awesome-material-components&via=webdenim&hashtags=materialdesign,frontend,webdesign,webdev,mobiledev,androiddev,iosdev) among your friends! Thank you!
